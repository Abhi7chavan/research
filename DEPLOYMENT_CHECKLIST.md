## üìä Research Data Collection

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test both URLs load correctly
- [ ] Verify performance monitor shows correct platform
- [ ] Check browser console for performance data
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits on both sites
- [ ] Test heavy render button functionality
- [ ] Monitor FPS during intensive operations
- [ ] Test DOM manipulation features

### Performance Comparison Tools
1. **Browser DevTools**
   - Network tab for load times
   - Performance tab for runtime analysis
   - Lighthouse for comprehensive metrics

2. **Online Tools**
   - GTmetrix: [gtmetrix.com](https://gtmetrix.com)
   - PageSpeed Insights: [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev)
   - WebPageTest: [webpagetest.org](https://webpagetest.org)

3. **Load Testing**
   - Artillery.io for load testing
   - Browser-based stress testing
