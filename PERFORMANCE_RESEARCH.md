# Platform Performance Research

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objective
Compare Render vs Railway for AI website builder deployment focusing on:
- Deployment speed and reliability
- Runtime performance
- Cost efficiency
- Developer experience

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring Framework

### Deployment Metrics to Track:
1. **Build Time** - Time from commit to build completion
2. **Deploy Time** - Time from build to live site
3. **Total Time** - End-to-end deployment duration
4. **Success Rate** - Failed vs successful deployments
5. **Cold Start Time** - Time for first request after idle

### Runtime Performance Metrics:
1. **Response Time** - Initial page load
2. **TTFB** (Time to First Byte)
3. **FCP** (First Contentful Paint)
4. **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
5. **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
6. **FID** (First Input Delay)

## ðŸ”¬ Research Plan

### Phase 1: Deployment Comparison
- [ ] Deploy same site to both platforms
- [ ] Record deployment times and processes
- [ ] Document any deployment issues

### Phase 2: Performance Testing
- [ ] Use browser dev tools for performance metrics
- [ ] Test from multiple geographic locations
- [ ] Measure under different load conditions

### Phase 3: Developer Experience
- [ ] Compare UI/UX of dashboards
- [ ] Evaluate debugging capabilities
- [ ] Assess configuration complexity
